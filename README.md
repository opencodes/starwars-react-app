# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`
### `test:coverage`

### Due to time constraints I am keeping a hard stop and putting my future enhancement guide
### Future Enhancement
- Unit test for each function and component
- Cache API Data
- Load Films, Planets, Starship & Vechicle on demand and cache
